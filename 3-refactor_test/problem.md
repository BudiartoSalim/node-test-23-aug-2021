# Refactor Code
Code to be refactored: before.js

Solutions:
- after-iterative.js = uses normal for loop
- after-recursive.js = uses recursive
- after-str-funcs.js = not using any ifs or loops, all uses Javascript built-in functions
- after-regex.js = uses regex instead of substr then string split, trim the brackets, then join again before returning
